This article presents a comparative study of four morphological parsers
of Russian – mystem, pymorphy2, TreeTagger, and FreeLing – involving the two
main tasks of morphological analysis: lemmatization and POS tagging. The experiments  were  conducted  on  three  currently  available  Russian  corpora  which
have  qualitative  morphological  labeling  –  Russian  National  Corpus,  OpenCorpora,  and  RU-EVAL  (a  small  corpus  created  in  2010  to  evaluate  parsers).  As
evaluation measures, the authors use accuracy for lemmatization and F1-measure
for POS tagging. The authors give error analysis, identify the most difficult parts
of speech for the parsers, and analyze the work of parsers on dictionary words
and predicted words.
